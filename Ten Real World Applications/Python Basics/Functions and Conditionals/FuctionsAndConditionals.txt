Summary: Functions and Conditionals
In this section you learned to:

To define a function:
def cube_volume(a):
    return a * a * a
To write a conditional block:
message = "hello there"

if "hello" in message:
    print("hi")
else:
    print("I don't understand")
To write a conditional block of multiple conditions:
message = "hello there"

if "hello" in message:
    print("hi")
elif "hi" in message:
    print("hi")
elif "hey" in message:
    print("hi")
else:
    print("I don't understand")
To check if a value is of a certain typewith:
isinstance("abc", str)
isinstance([1, 2, 3], list)
or

type("abc") == str
type([1, 2, 3]) == lst
